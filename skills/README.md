# Skills

This directory is reserved for custom skills that extend metaskills' capabilities.

## About Skills

metaskills is intentionally minimal and does not ship with domain-specific skills. This directory is where you can add your own skills to customize Claude's behavior for your specific workflows, tech stack, or project needs.

## Adding Skills

To add a skill:

1. Create a new directory under `skills/` with your skill name (e.g., `skills/my-custom-skill/`)
2. Add a `SKILL.md` or similar file that describes the skill
3. Skills will be automatically picked up by Claude Code if they follow the expected format

## Examples

You might create skills for:

- Language-specific patterns (Swift, Python, TypeScript, etc.)
- Framework-specific workflows (React, FastAPI, Rails, etc.)
- CI/CD pipeline management
- Database migrations
- Testing strategies

metaskills will help Claude use these skills more intelligently without imposing any particular development methodology.

## Status

This directory is currently empty by design. Add your own skills as needed for your projects.
